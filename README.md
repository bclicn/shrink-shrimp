__Note:__  You would need to pre-install `ghostscript` on __OSX__ and __Ubuntu__ in order to use this app.

## Develop ##
Assume you have `nodejs 10+` and `npm` installed.

    cd /to/some/dir/
    git clone https://github.com/bclicn/shrink-shrimp.git

    // for chinese users
    npm install -g mirror-config-china --registry=http://registry.npm.taobao.org

    npm install
    npm start

## Build ##

Follow the steps in __Develop__ then

    // windows 64bit
    npm run build-win
    // OSX
    npm run build-mac
    // Linux
    npm run build-linux 

__Note:__ after building on windows, you can download [gs-926-win32-x64.zip](https://github.com/bclicn/shrink-shrimp/releases), unzip, then copy `gsdll64.dll` and `gs.exe` to the same directory of `Shrink-Shrimp.exe`, which makes GhostScript installation free.
